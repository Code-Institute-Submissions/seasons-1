<bold>Seasons</bold> is the path into your healthy lifestyle. A site that cares for the well being of the user and the planet. It is no secret a healthy diet leads to a healthy and enjoyable lifestyle. Seasonal eating is not just good for us and the planet but it is also a delicious way of approaching a better life. When produce is in the season it at its natural and its ripest. All of our produce is sourced within the UK and is picked, packed and shipped when it is ripe. None of our produce is frozen to be eaten later all  food delivered to the consumer 
is picked and packed within the week you order it.

You can order a box for the month you decide to order or you can subscribe to the season which you choose. I f you sign up to the winter months you will receive all the freshest fruit and vegetables
for the months in winter.

## Design
### Colour Scheme


![Inspiration Color Palette](media/wireframes/colour-chart-inspiration.png)

<p>As an e-commerce store I wanted the focus to be on the products and images, so when choosing the colour scheme I wanted it to be clam and not overpowering. I wanted the colours
to fit in the aesthetic of the site, as the site is based around seasonality I wanted the colours to match this. The original inspiration for the colour scheme was warm tropical bright colours that make people feel almost as if they are on holiday, a way to bring out happiness
whilst searching through online sites. I wanted to utilize the fantastic colour that fresh fruit and vegetables can give off, ranging from bright tropical colours to low key earthy tones that do well to complement their surrounding elements.
</p>


### Fonts 
#### MainFont
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) I used this as my main font as it clean and stylish. As a font I find it is easy to read.

#### Main Colours Used 
##### Black 
I tried many colours for the nave bar and footer, but I ended up always going back to black. I found it not only had a stylish clean look to it but it complimented all of the hero images I was using for pages of the site. I used this for my search bar as well to keep it uniformed.
##### Mustard

- ![rgb(224, 157, 55)](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `rgb(224, 157, 55)`
Mustard worked very well at giving an Autumnal feel to the site, it is also not an invasive colour so it allows the pictures and elements around it to catch the eye.
##### Green 
- ![rgb(72, 153, 114, 0.75)](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `rgb(72, 153, 114, 0.75)`
The darker grass green colour was used for its calming effect and connotations to farming and fresh produce.


##### Salmon
- ![rgb(253, 89, 86, 0.5)](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `rgb(253, 89, 86, 0.5)`
I fell upon the salmon colour by chance, I was looking for a red colour to use but fond them to invasive> when I tested a salmon colour it worked well at not being overpowering but still adding a lively spark to the site.

##### Grey/Denim Blue
- ![rgba(192, 204, 216, 0.75))](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `rgba(192, 204, 216, 0.75)`
The grey denim blue was used initially to complement the green. It also has a rustic washed farm look and again gives a nice presence without taking centre stage.

### Logo
The logo was used in the nav-bar as a route back to the home page. The logo itself is a love heart made out of frut and vegetables with the sites tag line beside it.
[Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to design the logo.

### wireframes
#### Frameworks
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), front-end framework is chosen for this project for its modern interface, ease of use and ability to be easily customized. It is used for creating features such as navbar, cards, forms, modals, as well as for the layout.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for initializing some Bootstrap components, as well as for custom functions, DOM manipulation.

#### Wireframes
For my wireframes I first used pen and paper to jot down my original thoughts and then once I had a clearer picture in my head of
how I wanted the app to look I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to mock it up. The design did change from the pen and pad to Balsamiq
to actual coding as certain things did not look at good as I hoped, but overall it stayed pretty much the same.

## Features
### Existing features

#### Navbar

### Heroku deployment

1. Login to my Heroku account.
2. Click on New at the right top corner and click on Create new app (app name must be unique).
3. Choose App name and a region (Europe was the closest to me). Then click on Create app.
4. Go to the terminal window and create requirements.txt by running command `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt.` This will contain teh dependencies for the site.
5. Then create Procfile by running command echo web: python app.py > Procfile Remember P is capital
6. Add these files to the staging area by running command `git add requirements.txt & git add Procfile`.
7. Then commit these file respectively by running command `git commit -m "Added requirements.txt &  Added Procfile."`
8. Then push these files to GitHub by running command `git push`
Go to resources tab in Heroku, then in the  search bar look for Heorku Postgres(you can type `postgres`), select Hobby Dev — Free and click Provision button to add it to your project.     
6. In Heroku Settings click on Reveal Config Vars - set config vars as follows.   

| KEY            | VALUE         |
|----------------|---------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your aws access key>`  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your aws secret access key>`  |
| DATABASE_URL| `<your postgres database url>`  |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<your email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<your email address>`  |
| SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
| USE_AWS | `True`  |

8. Copy DATABASE_URL's value(Postrgres database URL) from the Convig Vars and temporary paste it into the default database in settings.py.     
You can temporary comment out the current database settings code and just paste the following in the settings.py:  

- DATABASES = {
'default':dj_database_url.parse('< your postgres >')
}

Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`

11. Create a superuser for the Postgres database by running the following command
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser` . You will be given instructions to type a username you want to yse along with a password into the terminal
12. Remove your Postgres URL database from the settings and uncomment the default DATABASE settings code in the settings.py file.  
13. Add  Heroku app URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS in the settings.py file.
14. Connect Heroku to GitHub to automatically deploy each time you push to GitHub.    

- Go to Deployment Method and click on Github Connect to Github.
- Then make sure your Github Profile is displayed and add your repository name and click on Search.
- Once it finds your repository click on Connect.
- No when you push to github yor code will also push to Heroku.
If you do not want to use automatic deploy you can do it manaully from  the terminal by following the commands ont websit [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/seasons-farm-box-you/deploy/heroku-git)

15. After the app has deployed successfully you can view by clicking open app on te heroku platform.
16. You will also need to verify your email address, so you need to login with your superuser credentials and verify your email address in the admin panel. Now you will be able to view the app running.   


##### Hosting media files with AWS
The **static files** and **media files** (that will be uploaded by superuser - product/subscription images) are hosted in the [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/). To host them, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with *public access*. More about setting it up you can read in [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and [this tutorial](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).
##### Senging email via Gmail
In order to send real emails from the application, you need to connect it to your Gmail account, setting up your email address in EMAIL_HOST_USER variable and your app password generated by your email provider in EMAIL_HOST_PASS variable.

## Information Architecture
### Database choice
During the development phase I worked with sqlite3 database which is installed with Django.   
For deployment(production), a PostgreSQL database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.
- The User model used in this project is provided by Django as a part of defaults `django.contrib.auth.models`.
