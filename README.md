## Information Architecture
### Database choice
During the development phase I worked with **sqlite3** database which is installed with Django.   
For deployment(production), a **PostgreSQL** database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.
- The **User model** used in this project is provided by Django as a part of defaults `django.contrib.auth.models`.
