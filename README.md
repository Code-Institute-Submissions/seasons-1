## Colour Scheme



![Inspiration Color Palette](wireframes/colour-chart-inspiration.png)

<p>As an e-commerce store I wanted the focus to be on the products and images, so when choosing the colour scheme I wanted it to be clam and not overpowering. I wanted the colours
to fit in the aesthetic of the site, as the site is based around seasonality I wanted the colours to match this. The original inspiration for the colour scheme was warm tropical bright colours that make people feel almost as if they are on holiday, a way to bring out happiness
whilst searching through online sites. I wanted to utilize the fantastic colour that fresh fruit and vegetables can give off, ranging from bright tropical colours to low key earthy tones that do well to complement their surrounding elements.
</p>

#### Main Colours Used 
 
 ##### Black 
 I tried many colours for the nave bar and footer, but I ended up always going back to black. I found it not only had a stylish clean look to it but it complimented all of the hero images I was using for pages of the site. I used this for my search bar as well to keep it uniformed.

 ##### Mustard
 Mustard worked very well at giving an Autumnal feel to the site, it is also not an invasive colour so it allows the pictures and elements around it to catch the eye.

##### Green 
The darker grass green colour was used for its calming effect and connotations to farming and fresh produce.

##### Salmon
I fell upon the salmon colour by chance, I was looking for a red colour to use but fond them to invasive> when I tested a salmon colour it worked well at not being overpowering but still adding a lively spark to the site.

##### Grey/Denim Blue
The grey denim blue was used initially to complement the green. It also has a rustic washed farm look and again gives a nice presence without taking centre stage.

#### Landing (home) page
 - <img src="/" alt="landing_page" target="_blank" rel="noopener" width="850">
The landing page serves to attract new users to the business, to give a clear understanding of what the company does and to attract users to use the website's functionality (subscribe/buy boxes). 
- **Hero image** section contains a full-screen image, main heading with a subheading and 2 buttons "Book tea ceremony" and "Buy tea or teaware" that redirect a user to the services and products pages, correspondingly. The purpose of this section is to attract new users, to make the first impression and to call to action.
- **Introduction about** section contains a summary of the company and its purpose. It also contains a CTA to which takes the user to the bout page which holds more information.
- **Boxes**  section contains a heading and image of a box of vegetables along with some information about the food boxes we supply and  CTA to the shop where users can buy the products. This is to give users an outline of what the company sells.
- **Subscriptions** section has a brief about how the company supplies boxes containing produce dependent on seasonality and how users can sign up for particular seasons. This section has an image of red fruit on a white background and a CTA to the subscriptions page.
- **Register** section contains a heading informing the user to register to the site above a circular picture of a happy customer in a farm environment using an I-pad the image was used to display the merge of technology and farming to make the connection of ordering fresh produce over the internet. This section also contains a CTA to the register page.

#### About page
 - <img src="/" alt="landing_page" target="_blank" rel="noopener" width="850">
The about page is used to tell the customer about how the company works through its tag line "from farm to box to you"
- **Hero image** The hero image of the about page is a long shot of a farm and mountains.  
- **Icons** A selection of 3 icons to about the tagline "from farm to box to you" wit a farm, box and person icon each having a sentence under each icon.

## Deployment

### Heroku deployment

1. Login to my Heroku account.
2. Click on New at the right top corner and click on Create new app (app name must be unique).
3. Choose App name and a region (Europe was the closest to me). Then click on Create app.
4. Go to the terminal window and create requirements.txt by running command `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt.` This will contain teh dependencies for the site.
5. Then create Procfile by running command echo web: python app.py > Procfile Remember P is capital
6. Add these files to the staging area by running command `git add requirements.txt & git add Procfile`.
7. Then commit these file respectively by running command `git commit -m "Added requirements.txt &  Added Procfile."`
8. Then push these files to GitHub by running command `git push`
   Go to resources tab in Heroku, then in the  search bar look for Heorku Postgres(you can type `postgres`), select Hobby Dev — Free and click Provision button to add it to your project.     
6. In Heroku Settings click on Reveal Config Vars - set config vars as follows.   

 | KEY            | VALUE         |
|----------------|---------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your aws access key>`  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your aws secret access key>`  |
| DATABASE_URL| `<your postgres database url>`  |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<your email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<your email address>`  |
| SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
| USE_AWS | `True`  |

8. Copy DATABASE_URL's value(Postrgres database URL) from the Convig Vars and temporary paste it into the default database in settings.py.     
You can temporary comment out the current database settings code and just paste the following in the settings.py:  

- DATABASES = {
    'default':dj_database_url.parse('< your postgres >')
    }

Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`

11. Create a superuser for the Postgres database by running the following command
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser` . You will be given instructions to type a username you want to yse along with a password into the terminal
12. Remove your Postgres URL database from the settings and uncomment the default DATABASE settings code in the settings.py file.  
13. Add  Heroku app URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS in the settings.py file.
14. Connect Heroku to GitHub to automatically deploy each time you push to GitHub.    

- Go to Deployment Method and click on Github Connect to Github.
- Then make sure your Github Profile is displayed and add your repository name and click on Search.
- Once it finds your repository click on Connect.
- No when you push to github yor code will also push to Heroku.

 If you do not want to use automatic deploy you can do it manaully from  the terminal by following the commands ont websit [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/seasons-farm-box-you/deploy/heroku-git)



-  **Deploy section -> **Deployment method** -> select **GitHub**
-  link the Heroku app to your GitHub repository for this project
- click **Enable Automatic Deploys** in the Automatic Deployment section
- Run `git push` command in the terminal, that would now push your code to both Github and Heroku, and perform the deployment.     

Alternatively, in the terminal you can run:    
- `heroku login`    
-  after adding and comitting to Git, run the following command:     
`git push heroku master`
15. After successful deployment, you can view your app bu clicking **Open App** on Heroku platform.
16. You will also need to verify your email address, so you need to login with your superuser credentials and verify your email address in the admin panel. Now you will be able to view the app running!    
##### Hosting media files with AWS
The **static files** and **media files** (that will be uploaded by superuser - product/service images) are hosted in the [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/). To host them, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with *public access*. More about setting it up you can read in [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and [this tutorial](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).
##### Senging email via Gmail
In order to se

9. Go back to Heroku to your App and click on deploy tab.
10. Then go to Deployment Method and click on Github Connect to Github.
11. Then make sure your Github Profile is displayed and add your repository name and click on Search.
12. Once it finds your repository then click on Connect.
13. Go to Settings at the top. Then click on Reveal Config Vars.
14. In Config Vars add IP with value 0.0.0.0 then add PORT as 5000 then add SECRET_KEY.
15. Go back to Deploy tab and click on Enable Automatic Deploys.
16. Click on Deploy Branch
17. It will take a minute and display a message that Your app was successfully deployed.
18. Click on View to launch your deployed app.



### Heroku Deployment
*To start Heroku Deployment process, you need to clone the project as described in the [Local deployment](#local-deployment) section above.*     
To deploy the project to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) the following steps need to be completed:    
1. Create a **requirement.txt** file, which contains a list of the dependencies, using the following command in the terminal:    
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`    
2. Create a **Procfile**, in order to tell Heroku how to run the project, using the following command in the terminal:      
`web: gunicorn art_of_tea.wsgi:application`    
3. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub repository.     
NOTE: these 1-3 steps already done in this project and included in the GitHub repository, but illistrated here as they are required for the successfull deployment to Heroku.        
As well as that, other things that are required for the Heroku deployment and have to be installed: **gunicorn** (WSGI HTTP Server), **dj-database-url** for database connection and **Psycopg** (PostgreSQL driver for Python). All of the mentioned above are *already installed* in this project in the requirements.txt file.     
4. On the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) website you need to create a **new app**, assigne a name (must be unique),set a region to the closest to you(for my project I set Europe) and click **Create app**.   
5. Go to **Resources** tab in Heroku, then in the **Add-ons** search bar look for **Heorku Postgres**(you can type `postgres`), select **Hobby Dev — Free** and click **Provision** button to add it to your project.     
6. In Heroku **Settings** click on **Reveal Config Vars**.   
7. Set the following config variables there:     

| KEY            | VALUE         |
|----------------|---------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your aws access key>`  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your aws secret access key>`  |
| DATABASE_URL| `<your postgres database url>`  |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<your email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<your email address>`  |
| GOOGLE_MAP_KEY| `<your google map key>`  |
| SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
| USE_AWS | `True`  |

Note: More about Google Map key settings can be found [here](#google-maps-api-key-set-up).
     
8. Copy **DATABASE_URL's value**(Postrgres database URL) from the Convig Vars and temporary paste it into the default database in **settings.py**.     
You can temporary comment out the current database settings code and just paste the following in the settings.py:   
```bash 
  DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL here>")     
    }
  ```
Important Note: that's just temporary set up, this URL **should not be committed and published to GitHub** for security reasons, so make sure not to commit your changes to Git while the URL is in the settings.py.     
9. Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`     
10. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**, **events**) into the  Postgres database using the following command:     
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`      
11. Create a **superuser** for the Postgres database by running the following command(*you need to follow the instructions and inserting username,email and password*):      
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`     
12. You need to remove your Postgres URL database from the settings and uncomment the default DATABASE settings code in the settings.py file.    
Note: for production you get the environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' from the Heroku Config Vars and use Postgress database, while for development you use the SQLite as a default database.     
13. Add your Heroku app URL to **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in the settings.py file.
14. You can connect Heroku to GitHub to automatically deploy each time you push to GitHub.    
To do so, from the Heroku dashboard follow the steps:
-  **Deploy** section -> **Deployment method** -> select **GitHub**
-  link the Heroku app to your GitHub repository for this project
- click **Enable Automatic Deploys** in the Automatic Deployment section
- Run `git push` command in the terminal, that would now push your code to both Github and Heroku, and perform the deployment.     

Alternatively, in the terminal you can run:    
- `heroku login`    
-  after adding and comitting to Git, run the following command:     
`git push heroku master`
15. After successful deployment, you can view your app bu clicking **Open App** on Heroku platform.
16. You will also need to verify your email address, so you need to login with your superuser credentials and verify your email address in the admin panel. Now you will be able to view the app running!    
##### Hosting media files with AWS
The **static files** and **media files** (that will be uploaded by superuser - product/service images) are hosted in the [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/). To host them, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with *public access*.
